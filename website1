 <!-name, bio, 3 episodes faced challenges, skills, recent projects->
    <P>Chris Green is a Deputy Manager for a German supermarket retailer here in the uk.</P>
      <p>Born, raised and schooled in the Lancaster area,
        he spent 15 years self employed as a draper before joining
        Aldi where he has been now for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Having only ever having one job, when his business came to an end he worried how he 
        would ever fit into another role but just a few weeks later he was busily working in a 
        new environment, full of enthusiasm. It was not long before he was promoted and is now 
        Deputy Manager with 30 staff to manage.</p>
      <p>Over the years Chris has developed -</p>
        <ul>
            <li> crucial industry expertise</li> 
            <li>accurate cash handling</li> 
            <li>solid customer service skills</li>
            <li>legal compliance</li>
    <p>Recently Chris has been part of the 'Project Fresh' team, who were integeral
        in revamping all the stores within the region.  He also oversaw the implementation
        of the self service checkout systems within his own store.
        Chris recently began taking a course in computer coding and hopes to gain the new
        skills required to open new avenues and perhaps start a new chapter in his life.</p>
